# OwnRepoCreator

Python - Automation- Own Repo Creator

# Functionality:

This program allows me to locate the main direction of my current repositories and automates the movement and the creation of folders, list all it's content and creating repositories with a VITE LAYOUT becouse I am a Front End Developer.

# Features:

- Locate you main folder of repos
- List of folders and a couple of actions. MOVE INSIDE FOLDERS, CREATE NEW FOLDERS AND CREATE REPOS.
- In the CREATE REPOS the program detects if you have NPM or PNPM. It is preferred to use PNPM for me but it has the option of using NPM.
- Then installs all dependecies, git init, open Visual Studio Code and runs the project layout.

# Requirements:

To run the program, you will need to have Python 3 installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

# Project Structure:

- main.py: The main file containing the program's logic.

# Installation:

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
3. Run main.py

Thank you for your attention.<br>
